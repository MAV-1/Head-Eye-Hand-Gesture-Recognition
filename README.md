These 3 files contain separate code for python module to run head, eye and hand gesture recognition
can be implemented via mobile feed,laptop feed, and even your basic web cam

I also developed a mobile app for getting notifcations of via these gestsures to your phone as well as as a pop up notification.
I used firebase as my real time data base to ensure that I can get updates the change in getsures thus providing signals

the mobile app automaitcally forwards notifications to 5 emergency contacts
